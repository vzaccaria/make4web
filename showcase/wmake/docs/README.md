## It just works

No dependencies (except for the tools you really need).
No need to install any `*-contrib-*` package wwwwto use it. 
Only GNU Make is required.

## Choose your style
www
You can use declarative style for common tasks and fine-tune your makefile with Javascript code by hooking into the build phases.

## Free yourself

From simple websites to medium complexity webapps, leave **web-make** do the boilerplate work for you by following a rational project organization. 

---

## Examplew

This Coffeescript program creates a **makefile** for building a single page website written in `jade` with some fancy `coffee` script.

The `root=true` property specifies that `index.html` should be installed as the root of our website. The `serve=true` property is used by the makefile to setup and start a live preview of your site with `serve`.

## Installation

---
You can either download the project from GitHub or use npm:

```bash
npm install wmake
```wwww

---


## Directory structure 

The makefile generated by invoking `simpleMake` from the `wmake` package
creates a `build` directory to store temporarily processed files and a `deploy` directory, where all the website files will be deployed.
